# README: Image Processing Application with Tkinter and PIL

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Image Processing application written in Python, utilizing the Tkinter library for the GUI and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation. The program allows users to load an image, apply grayscale, adjust brightness and contrast, and save the edited image.

## Introduction
The Image Processing application is a simple yet effective tool for basic image manipulation. It demonstrates the capabilities of Python's Tkinter and PIL libraries in creating GUI applications and handling image processing tasks.

## Tkinter Overview
Tkinter is Python's standard GUI toolkit, providing a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. It is a wrapper for the Tk GUI toolkit.

## PIL Overview
PIL (Python Imaging Library), now known as Pillow in its maintained version, is a library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats in Python.

## File Structure
The application is structured into two main classes:
- `ImageProcessor`: Handles image loading, manipulation (grayscale, brightness, and contrast adjustments), and saving.
- `ImageManipulator`: Manages the GUI components and interactions with `ImageProcessor`.

## Usage Guide
- **Load Image**: Click the 'Load Image' button to open an image file.
- **Convert to Grayscale**: Click the 'Convert to Grayscale' button to apply a grayscale effect.
- **Adjust Brightness/Contrast**: Use the sliders to adjust the brightness and contrast.
- **Save Image**: Click the 'Save Image' button to save the edited image.

## Tkinter Geometry Manager
The application uses Tkinter's `pack` geometry manager for placing widgets. The `pack` manager organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget. It's ideal for simple layouts and is used for its ease of use over more complex grid layouts. For more complex GUIs, the `grid` geometry manager might be more suitable.

### Key Features of `pack`:
- **Automatic Placement**: Places widgets in the order they are packed.
- **Direction Control**: Widgets can be packed to any side of the container.
- **Expansion and Filling**: Widgets can expand and fill the available space.
- **Padding**: Allows adding space around widgets.

## PIL Methods and Functions
- **Image.open()**: Opens and identifies the given image file.
- **Image.thumbnail()**: Resizes an image so it fits within a given size.
- **Image.convert()**: Converts the image to a different mode, like 'L' for grayscale.
- **ImageEnhance.Brightness()**: Adjusts the brightness of an image.
- **ImageEnhance.Contrast()**: Adjusts the contrast of an image.
- **Image.save()**: Saves the image with the given filename.
